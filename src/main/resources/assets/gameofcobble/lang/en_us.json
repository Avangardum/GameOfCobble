All empty slots that neighbor exactly 3 filled slots will spawn cobblestone. Cobblestone can be spawned outside of the inventory this way, in which case it will drop into the world. Multiple blocks can be combined into a bigger grid. Check JEI usages to see what else can be used beside just normal cobblestone.",
